<h2>Jump Bike Data for Sacramento</h2>

<p>This site is a hobby project I created just to see what is happening with the Jumb Bike system in the Sacramento area</p>
<p>The data is drawn from the Jump Bike developer API documented <a href="https://app.socialbicycles.com/developer/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm really just getting started on this and the data collection only began today, August, 10 2018. I have plans for more detailed reporting soon.</p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:6pt;">Current Data:</h4>
<p>Total Bikes: {{ data.bikes }}</p>
<p>Total Sightings: {{ data.sightings }}</p>
<p>Total Trips: {{ data.trips }}</p>
