## Jump Bike Data for Sacramento

This site is a hobby project I created just to see what is happening with the Jump Bike system in the Sacramento area.

The information is updated every few minutes using data provided by Jump through the General Bikeshare Feed Specification which is documented 
[on Github](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs "GBFS Spec").

More information is available in the [About page](/about/ ). Also, as I make changes I sometimes document them on the [News](/news/) page.
