## Jump Bike Data for Sacramento

This site is a hobby project I created just to see what is happening with the Jump Bike system in the Sacramento area.

The information is updated every few minutes using data provided by Jump through the Jump Bike developer API which is documented 
[here](https://app.socialbicycles.com/developer/ "Developer API").

I'm really just getting started on this and the data collection only began in earnest on August, 13 2018. More information is available in 
our [About page](/about/ ).
